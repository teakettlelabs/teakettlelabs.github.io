  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In our <a href="/blog/2022/09/29/concrete-harms-of-llms.html">last post</a> we talked about how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be biased and the harms that they can cause, but now it’s useful to delve into some of the details of how exactly LLMs work, how people use them, and why it can be a problem if we ascribe more accuracy and authority to them than they warrant.</p>

<h3 id="fluency-understanding-and-how-llms-work">Fluency, Understanding, and How LLMs Work</h3>

<p>LLMs are AI models that deal with language, which is an incredibly complex aspect of human behavior, culture, and understanding that involves quite a lot of nuance and context. We as humans often struggle to understand one another, so asking LLMs to do so is quite a tall order. LLMs have grown much more powerful over the past few years, however, and often seem like they actually are understanding human language. The big issue here, however, is separating fluency from actual understanding.</p>

<p>Fluency comes from being very good at patterns and guessing what might come next in a sequence. A fluent model can produce language that sounds natural and has correct grammar and word usage, making it easy for a human to read. Understanding on the other hand is actually much more complex and comes from an underlying knowledge of concepts, intent, meaning, and cross-relations. If a black box is fluent enough, humans are good at extrapolating an assumption of understanding, regardless of whether the model itself has any actual understanding. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.463">Bender and Koller (2020)</a> have argued that a model trained only on <em>form</em> and not <em>meaning</em> cannot learn <em>meaning</em>, even if there is a <strong>lot</strong> of <em>form</em>. The typical way LLMs are trained is by using huge (generally unlabeled) datasets where the models pick up all they know simply via the form of the data without any connection to further context, which leads to models that are trained to be fluent and focus on patterns, not to express understanding.</p>

<p>In particular, a lot of the current work on language models can trace its roots back to a famous quote in the history of linguistics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You shall know a word by the company it keeps (Firth, J. R. 1957)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, in turn, is based on an older quote often attributed to Aesop about the character of a person being judged by the company they keep. If we think about the Aesop version for a moment, we might feel a bit of social discomfort about it. To the ears of our more modern sensibilities, it feels like an unfair snap judgment to decide how we view someone based solely on their friends and acquaintances rather than on who they are as a multi-faceted person.</p>

<p>The same is true of words. Training form is scalable and tractable, so we do it, but words, concepts, and languages are multi-faceted too.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P16-2096">The Social Impact of Natural Language Processing</a> (Hovy &amp; Spruit, 2016), a point is made that language is always <em>situated</em>, that is to say that language, as a proxy for human behavior, is uttered in a specific situation, at a particular place and time, and by an individual. All of those factors have an effect of adding latent information to the communication intent beyond just the text, meaning that training based on form alone is a very shallow representation of a very deep concept.</p>

<h3 id="mistaking-fluency-for-understanding">Mistaking Fluency for Understanding</h3>

<p>Because LLMs produce such fluent output, it can be incredibly easy for humans to mistake that fluency for understanding. When we delve deeper and examine the limitations of the models, however, it quickly becomes apparent that these systems are brittle and sometimes just a small agitation can make them produce output that is not only incorrect, but often seems ridiculous or nonsensical to humans. Even more concerning is when the output doesn’t seem ridiculous, but rather perpetuates falsehoods that can be harmful if taken at face value.</p>

<h4 id="human-cues">Human Cues</h4>

<p>Cues can be a way for a person or system to figure out what to do without actually having a deeper understanding of a problem. A salient historical example is <em>Clever Hans</em>, a horse that was apparently trained to do arithmetic and tap his hoof a certain number of times to represent answers - only for people to later discover that he had learned to look for cues from the human as to whether he should keep tapping or stop. And as humans, we leak cues in a lot of what we do, and a good-enough pattern recognizer zeroes in on those.</p>

<p>For instance, <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2002.04108">Adversarial Filters of Dataset Biases</a> (Bras et al., 2020) shows that the state-of-the-art results in question-answering tests like SQuAD achieved by transformer models are frequently responding to artifacts in how the question was formulated, and performing adversarial transformations of the questions makes the state-of-the-art models perform more poorly (reduction from 92% to 62% for SNLI using RoBERTa).</p>

<h4 id="incorrect-anchoring">Incorrect Anchoring</h4>

<p>Another interesting example of mistaken understanding comes from <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/P18-1079">Semantically Equivalent Adversarial Rules for Debugging NLP Models</a> (Ribeiro et al., 2018), where an interaction with a question-answering (QA) model went as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Q: How long is the Rhine?
A: 1230 km.
Q: How long is the Rhine??
A: More than 1,050,000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From seeing just the first answer, we might assume the QA model “understood” the question. But the second answer is baffling, till we see the training corpus included the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The biggest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about 1230 km (760 mi).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it’s unknown what caused the system to behave this way, we can theorize that the model probably connected “long” with having to respond with a number, and probably connected “??” with an intensification, thus pulling a larger number. “Rhine” probably allowed it to connect to a context locality in its training text.</p>

<p>If we were only to ask the first version of the question, we never would have realized that the model had this issue. We take it for granted that since the first version produced a reasonable answer, any similar question would produce the same one just as it would for a human. If we realize that what the model has learned is just based on form rather than deeper understanding, though, it makes sense that a variation in the form of the question might affect the answer that significantly. The model is anchoring on that form rather than any deeper understanding of the question or text.</p>

<h4 id="statistical-default-values">Statistical Default Values</h4>

<p>Visual QA systems, as shown by the same paper, demonstrate further problems that might be the result of a statistical association with a default value for certain types of questions.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, this picture of a family in front of a pink tray, the following questions asked of the model, and its responses. If <em>Green</em> is the most statistically likely color in our training set, even if the model has been trained to predict that the <strong>color</strong> of the object in question in this image is <em>Pink</em>, the slight perturbation of asking it for <strong>colour</strong> is sufficient to throw it off. More so, perturbations in other words in the query which reduce the likelihood of the specific prediction can make default predictions have an outsized effect.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>What color is the tray?</td>
      <td>Pink</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What <strong>colour</strong> is the tray?</td>
      <td>Green</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Which</strong> color is the tray?</td>
      <td>Green</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that these problems are not unique to visual systems - they’re just very easy to see there. As long as we’re doing “statistically most likely” predictions, infrequent items that lack close equivalents will often result in default predictions even with slight perturbations.</p>

<h4 id="false-facts">False Facts</h4>

<p>Even when LLMs are performing incredibly well and producing exactly the right answers based on the data, they still lack any understanding of what makes information correct. They are unable to judge the credibility of a source or recognize any issues that may come from using a source with untrue or harmful content. Given that many LLMs are trained on huge uncurated/unverified datasets scraped from the internet (and we all know the quality issues with information found randomly on the internet), this can be a real problem as the LLMs effectively memorize what they find regardless of source. Even if they become fluent in language itself, when they are used on downstream tasks like question-answering, summarization, information retrieval, or search, we can see errors in judgment that these LLMs simply weren’t designed to deal with.</p>

<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2109.07958">TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods</a> (Lin et al., 2022) provides a couple of interesting insights regarding this. They created a benchmark of questions for which there exist misinformation or conspiracies, and tried to see if the models would pick up and internalize those conspiracies. To no one’s surprise, it turns out that they do!</p>

<p>What is interesting in particular about this paper was their discovery that larger models were in fact <em>less truthful</em> than smaller ones. Whether this is due to needing a larger amount of data and having a worse quality of that data, or whether the larger models got better at trying to associate these kinds of question prompts with these answers (a non-conspiracy theorist is not likely to go around asking who caused 9/11), or some other reason is difficult to discern, but these should definitely give us pause when deciding how to use LLMs.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-use-llms">How We Use LLMs</h3>

<p>LLMs have amazing potential to be useful in all sorts of applications, many of which are being developed and implemented right now. It’s important to think carefully about the limitations of LLMs, especially regarding fluency vs understanding, when deciding how much authority we invest in their outputs before making real-world decisions based on them. Considering both the accuracy of the models as well as the impact of any decision is key. We’ll explore three types of usage here, how much authority the model has in each case, and when each type may be most appropriate.</p>

<h4 id="assistive-usage">Assistive Usage</h4>

<p>For assistive usage, models are being used to aid a human being. The model itself is not “taking action” for the core need of the application, but rather it is doing some processing and aiding a human being with information that the human makes decisions on (e.g., writing assistants).</p>

<p>This type of usage assumes that the human is still in charge of all decision making, leaving all issues of understanding and judgment to them rather than the machine. This can be a great use of LLMs as it allows scaling and efficiency (who of us hasn’t appreciated a search engine figuring out what exactly we meant to search for!) and avoids some of the pitfalls of LLMs lacking understanding.</p>

<p>There can be issues, however, if the models are treated with too much authority and the human assumes the model is always correct, especially if the human has no way to check the veracity of the output. For example, imagine using a machine translation system where you can’t understand one of the languages. You’d have no way to tell if what was translated was correct or not, and in high-stakes situations, this can be incredibly problematic (such as the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2017-10-22/ty-article/palestinian-arrested-over-mistranslated-good-morning-facebook-post/0000017f-db61-d856-a37f-ffe181000000">mistranslation of “good morning” in Arabic to “attack them” in Hebrew</a> we mentioned in our first <a href="/blog/2022/09/01/ethics-and-llms.html">post</a> in this series).</p>

<h4 id="aggregate-usage">Aggregate Usage</h4>

<p>In these kinds of uses, each individual action of the model is not associated with human interaction, but the aggregate it produces might be looked at by a human and decisions made on that.</p>

<p>For instance, sentiment analysis might be used to determine how well a product is received, analyzing reviews and reactions of people online. At this point, people using the model are doing A/B testing, looking at aggregate scores, and are not looking at the individual predictions the model made. This can be enormously useful because of how well it scales and allows a birds-eye view of trends. The issue, of course, is that if we aren’t looking at the data itself or questioning those trends, if we give the models too much authority and assume they are always correct, we might make decisions based on faulty data or biased models.</p>

<p>As a concrete case, Robyn Speer writes about trying to build a system for restaurant reviews and finding that it <a href="http://blog.conceptnet.io/posts/2017/conceptnet-numberbatch-17-04-better-less-stereotyped-word-vectors/">ranked Mexican restaurants lower</a>. This was traceable to the fact that the word embeddings used had negative connotations with the word “Mexican.” Thankfully, she noticed the problem and took steps to account for that. If not for that, such a system could be viewed in aggregate by a user of the system, who would not spot any problems with one restaurant that is summarized as 4.2 stars, while another is 3.8 stars. We just assume one of them is better than the other, and this directly affects their businesses.</p>

<p>In all these cases, the main problem is that the pattern of aggregate usage assumes that the model output is reliable and aggregatable, and so we don’t notice when things go awry. If we aren’t carefully looking at the data and questioning the output, we might take at face value something that really requires human judgment and discernment to spot issues with.</p>

<h4 id="independent-usage">Independent Usage</h4>

<p>In both the above cases, the presence of a human in the loop means that it is possible for a human to feel something isn’t quite right and go investigate. But a growing business use case for AI today is to enable scaling to a point where the human is not needed or needed only when things go wrong.</p>

<p>Say, for instance, automating customer support Q&amp;A, or content moderation. This can be useful because of how important an instantaneous response is (such as removing toxic content before users have to view it), or how well it scales to users (allowing customer support without any wait time). However, it is frequently the case that determining whether human intervention is needed is also performed by a model that automates that triage, which can be incredibly problematic. In these cases, the customers will have no recourse to solve their problem, and the people developing products that use these kinds of automation often will not know there are issues until after they’ve already lost those customers due to poor experience.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that LLMs are incredibly useful, but also understand their limitations. Being aware of the difference between the fluency of their output versus any understanding, judgment, or veracity of that output, is key to recognizing which kind of usage is appropriate in which type of circumstance. In our next post, we’ll dive a little deeper into the way that LLMs work by examining that all-important component: data!</p>
